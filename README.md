For more information about the BikeTourPlus application

## BikeTourPlus
BikeTourPlus is a bike tour management system board game where a user is able to interact with the app to book a tour based on their availablities. The system is controlled by one manager who controls the gear, combos and assigns the lodges, participants, guides based on the availablity of the stakeholders and the constraints of the project. A participant can choose to either stay in the lodge or not.

The description of proposed app can be found [here](https://github.com/F2022-ECSE223/ecse223-group-project-p3/blob/main/2022-03%20ECSE223%20Project%20-%20Description.pdf).

## Project and Documentation
