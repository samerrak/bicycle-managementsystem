Feature: Update BikeTourPlus Information (p8)
  As a manager, I want to update the BikeTourPlus information so that the information is accurate

  Background: 
    Given the following BikeTourPlus system exists: (p8)
      | startDate  | nrWeeks | priceOfGuidePerWeek |
      | 2023-03-13 |      10 |                 100 |

  Scenario Outline: Update BikeTourPlus information successfully
    When the manager attempts to update the BikeTourPlus information to start date "<startDate>", number of weeks "<nrWeeks>", and price of guide per week "<priceOfGuidePerWeek>" (p8)
    Then the BikeTourPlus information shall be start date "<startDate>", number of weeks "<nrWeeks>", and price of guide per week "<priceOfGuidePerWeek>" (p8)

    Examples: 
      | startDate  | nrWeeks | priceOfGuidePerWeek |
      | 2023-03-14 |      10 |                 100 |
